# Voice-based-Email-service-for-visually-challenged-people
Final Year MCA Project

Abstract
    
    . Due to  simplicity and accessibility, Internet is widely used in almost all the communication applications. In the 
    recent times,number of application based on internet have been developed to make the communication as a more reliable 
    and efficient in nature.Out of this numerous applications, E-mail is the most widely used and reliable way to 
    communicate with each other.
    
    .The usage of e-mail is quiet easy  for regular users but when it comes to the user with visual defect, the system is 
    yet very difficult to use. This arises a significant need to upgrade the existing system to make it more useful for the 
    visually impaired. 
    
    . Thus, in this Project I used IVR- Interactive voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts 
    using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform all the other useful tasks. The system will prompt the
    user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same. 
    
    . The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond
    through voice and mouse click only.
    
    .This system will perform actions based on the clicks only that is left click or right click, it does not depends on the
    portion of the screen where the cursor is placed before the click giving user the freedom to click blindly anywhere on
    the screen.

Existing System

    1. The existing system uses mainly three type of technologies like
        STT (Speech to Text): here whatever we speak will be converted to text,
        TTS (Text to Speech): this is opposite of STT method, here the text written on the screen will be read by the system
        
    2. If cursor moves over register icon it would sound register button, after clicking on register button it would give a 
        voice notification like you are on registration page
        
    3. After registration, user has to go to login page and type user id & password which will be recognized through database 
        enabling the correct user to get access to his/her account
        
    4. Also, there will be an icon for logout, which would read as logout when mouse goes or rolls over it. So, when the user 
        wants can logout from the system
        
    5. user should be well versed with the keyboard as to where each and every key is located. A user is new to computer can 
        therefore not use this service as they are not aware of the key locations.
        
DisAdvantage
    
    1. The existing system uses mainly  STT (Speech to Text): here whatever we speak will be converted to text
 
    2. User will be very well guided with the help of voice commands, while registering all the necessary fields to be filled
        will be read by site, by clicking on that box he/she would have to fill in them
        
    3. user has to go to login page and type user id & password which will be recognized through database enabling the correct
        user to get access to his/her account
        
    4. the user cannot make use of mouse pointer as it is completely inconvenient if the pointer location cannot be traced
    
    5. Not too much friendly for  visually challenged people.

Proposed System

    1. Unlike current system which emphasizes more on user friendliness of normal users, our system focuses more on user 
        friendliness of all types of people including normal people visually impaired people as well as illiterate people. 
        The complete system is based on IVR- interactive voice response.
        
    2. When using this system the computer will be prompting the user to perform specific operations to avail respective 
        services and if the user needs to access the respective services then he/she needs to perform that operation. 
        
    3. One of the major advantages of this system is that user won’t require to use the keyboard. All operations will be 
        based on mouse click events. 
        
    4. This system will be perfectly accessible to all types of users as it is just based on simple mouse clicks and speech 
        inputs and there is no need to remember keyboard shortcuts.
       
    5. Also because of IVR facility those who cannot read, need not worry as they can listen to the prompting done by the 
        system and perform respective actions

Advantage

    1. The disabilities of visually impaired people are thrashed .
   
    2. This system makes the disabled people feel like a normal user.
   
    3. They can hear the recently received mails.
    
    4. User will be very well guided with the help of voice commands
    
    5. User Friendly
